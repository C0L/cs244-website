<h1>Assignment 4: Blog Post and Final Presentation </h1>
</div>
<p><b>Presentations: May 30 and June 4, in class</b>
<b>Report Due: Saturday, June 8, 2024 at 6:30PM</b></p>
<p>You've spent the past 7 weeks striving to replicate a result from a prior
publication. Now it's time to report on your results and share them!</p>
<h1>1 Presentation </h1>
<p>Your group will give a 10 minute presentation in class. We'll randomly
assign groups to the 2 class meetings. If you want to swap days, you'll
need to find a group to swap with. To swap, a member from each group
should email the staff list about the swap.</p>
<p>You should expect that a good part of your 10 minutes is questions and
discussion. So you should plan on presenting for 5-6 minutes. You can
structure your presentation in any way you want. It should provide
the following information (recall that most people in the class know
nothing about your project!):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What paper did you focus on?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What is the relevant intellectual contribution of this paper that you ended up focusing on?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What is the result or claim you sought to replicate, what does it mean, and why this one?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What did you do to replicate the result?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What were your results?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What do you conclude?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>5 minutes is not much time: you should keep the number of slides small.
And practice! Since it only takes 5 minutes, the improvement you'll 
see in your presentation from practice, given how important this is
to your grade, is absolutely time well spent. Time yourself.</p>
<p>For example, one structure might be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Slide 1: Paper and key idea</p>
</li>
<li><p>Slide 2: Graph and methodology</p>
</li>
<li><p>Slide 3: Results</p>
</li>
<li><p>Slide 4: Observations</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>2 Final Report (blog post)</h1>
<p>Your final report is a blog post on 
<a href="https://reproducingnetworkresearch.wordpress.com/about">Reproducing Networking Research</a>. Read a few prior posts and find some that you think
are good work you'd like to emulate; you can use their structure
as a starting point for your own post.</p>
<p>Your report should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a short introduction that explains the paper, its contributions, and their importance,</p>
</li>
<li><p>the result or claim you chose and why,</p>
</li>
<li><p>the methodology described in the paper,</p>
</li>
<li><p>the methodology you used (and if it diverged, why),</p>
</li>
<li><p>the results you obtained, alongside the original results in a way that lets the reader usefully compare them (e.g. match graph axes if appropriate),</p>
</li>
<li><p>a discussion of your process or details in replicating the result, or a discussion of why you think your results do not agree,</p>
</li>
<li><p>anything else you've learned that you think would be useful to others trying to understand the paper in context.</p>
</li>
</ul>
