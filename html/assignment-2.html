<h1>Assignment 2: Project Proposal</h1>
</div>
<p><b>Due: Wednesday, April 17, 2024 at 11:59PM</b></p>
<p>In this milestone, your team will propose the research result to replicate
in your prjoect.</p>
<h1>1 Questions to answer</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the <b>paper</b> that you have selected? Please give a full
citation that includes the names of all authors, the title, the venue
that published it, the year of publication, and a URL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Has the paper previously been the subject of a post on the
reproducingnetworkingresearch blog? (Answer must be &ldquo;no&rdquo; unless you
have an exception from us.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the relevant <b>intellectual contribution</b> of this paper that
you will focus on? Explain this in language that is accessible to
somebody who has not read the paper. The goal is to explain, &ldquo;what
does the paper purport to teach the reader?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: &ldquo;The paper contributes a new method/technique/approach for
solving the problem of A, which arises in the context of B. The new
method/technique/approach is C.&rdquo; Or: &ldquo;This paper describes an
interesting measurement/discovery/finding in the area of A, which is
important in the context of B because of C. The discovery/finding is
reported to be D.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Before the paper arrived, what was the &ldquo;status quo ante&rdquo;? I.e. what
was the state of knowledge before the paper and its intellectual
contributions arrived? How would a well-educated reader have
approached some problem, or what would they have said about the world,
before learning what the paper has to teach?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the <b>result</b> or <b>claim</b> that you will replicate, that is
related to the intellectual contribution you identified above?  Please
identify a particular figure or number and cite where it is mentioned
in the paper. Please screenshot the figure or number and include an
excerpt in your report.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>In your own words, what is the result saying? E.g., &ldquo;The
experiments found that the new method/technique/approach produces a
13% improvement in convergence time compared with the best prior
work,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the measurements found that the distribution of TCP
flow sizes is well-approximated by an exponential distribution
with parameter value x.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Briefly outline the steps your team will do to <b>replicate</b> this
result. What infrastructure or software will you take from prior work?
What will you build by following the paper's instructions? What
part(s)/lines/numbers from the figure or text that you screenshotted
will you attempt to replicate? At a high level, how do you plan to
divide the work between the team members?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Draw a &ldquo;sketch&rdquo; of what the resulting replication <b>might</b> look like.
E.g. if you're planning to redraw two of the lines from a graph, draw
those lines freehand just to illustrate what the result of your
replication might be. (Okay to do this by hand.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>What are some risks to your ability to complete the replication
project?  (What is the scariest part of your proposed plan, or the
part most likely to fail?) What will you do as a fallback/mitigation
in case these risks arise?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>What do you plan to have done in time for the midterm
report (May 13)?</p>
</li>
</ul>
